TODOS:
-----------------------------------------------

 - Formalize triggers in the collisions system
 - Perhaps make entity ids fixed point, where the first few bits specify the entity type,
   and then the next few bits specify the index

 - Improve user input, it could be done way better! Maybe not have user input be global?
 - Cleanup editor

 - Improve framerate independence, it is almost there but the integration when there isn't
     enough frametime to make a full timestep can be improved

 - Dragonfly wings in a separate sprite

 - Better entity system
     - Fix don't use a percent for Snail AI
     - Allow different AIs for enemies
     - Snail spawner
     - Perhaps a system to calculate the snail endpoints

     - Improve collision system, it is almost there
     - Add a wall_group entity instead of having an individual entity for each wall
     - When the player is riding a dragonfly when it turns, possibly interpolate the player
       position to look better when riding the dragonfly

 - Improve asset system
     - Formalize asset loading, almost there
     - Formalize player spawn
     - Allow a variable number of coins in a level
     - Allow a variable number of animations in a spritesheet_asset instead of having it
       fixed size
     - Asset 'specs' like Y-Offset, etc.
     - Scale assets so that it doesn't need to be scaled when exported. This may save
       some memory on the GPU and on lower end machines might actually provide a small
       performance gain on the renderer.
         - Profile this to see if there is even a difference at all(though the difference
             may be more pronounced on lower end machines).

 - Improve the Z layer

 - Hotloading
     - Variables file a la Jonathan Blow's games

 - Use the new stb_truetype baking API
     - Is this need if we aren't actually going to have text in the game?
	   Text will likely only be used for debugging purposes

 - Audio!!!
     - Load WAV files

 - Proper random number generation

 - Multithreading & SIMD, should this be done if we want compatibility with older lower end
   machines?

 - Possibly create a 'legacy' OpenGL renderer that uses the fixed function pipeline
   for older machines

 - Editor, How fancy do we want to get?
     - Drag entity path endpoints
     - Undo/Redo

BUGS:
-----------------------------------------------
 - Investigate why the amount of time for the first frame is greater that succeeding frames
     - Is this still a problem???

 - Snail direction sometimes change at start
 - In editor, remove last level doesn't check the current level
 - Score doesn't reset on level change, easy fix
 - Friction isn't applied if a player quickly changes the direction they are moving
 - Player can jump while falling
 - Player can kinda fall through dragonfly when turning
 - Player can get stuck when walking onto the dragonfly's torso, if the dragonfly happens
   to be under a platform
     - Might not be a problem if the player size changes
 - POSSIBLY: Collision event should be reset when a new collision is detected
 - Riding on dragonfly go directly under a wall can cause the riding player to get stuck
 - Dragonflies don't move with two collision boxes
 - Snails sometimes do the turning animation twice
 - Snail falls through the floor
IDEAS:
-----------------------------------------------
 - Randomize enemy directions on start
