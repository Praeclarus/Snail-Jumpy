TODOS:
-----------------------------------------------

 - Better entity system
     - Improve collision system!!!
     - Improve entity system, it is currently too hard to add a new entity
     - Ability to remove entities from the system - Is this needed???
     - Change Snail AI, make it not depend on phony walls? Maybe use paths?
         - This would also allow a sort of speed up in the middle, slow down at the ends.
           Also if this is applied to Dragonfly AI as it would allow for more complex
           paths

     - Add a wall_group entity instead of having an individual entity for each wall

 - Improve asset system
     - Formalize asset loading, almost there
     - Perhaps use different bits to represent different entities
     - Add Sally back in
     - Formalize player spawn

 - Hotloading
     - Variables file a la Jonathan Blow's games

 - Use the new stb_truetype baking API
     - Is this need if we aren't actually going to have text in the game?
	   Text will likely only be used for debugging purposes

 - Audio!!!
     - Load WAV files

 - Multithreading & SIMD, should this be done if we want compatibility with older lower end
   machines?

 - Possibly create a 'legacy' OpenGL renderer that uses the fixed function pipeline
   for older machines

 - Editor, How fancy do we want to get?
     - Ability to add Sallies and dragonflies
     - Remove any levels
     - Undo/Redo

BUGS:
-----------------------------------------------
 - Investigate why the amount of time for the first frame is greater that succeeding frames
     - Is this still a problem???

 - Snail direction sometimes change at start
 - In editor, remove last level doesn't check the current level
 - Score doesn't reset on level change, easy fix
 - Friction isn't applied if a player quickly changes the direction they are moving
 - Player can jump while falling
