 - Better entity system
     - Improve entity allocation
     - Ability to remove entities from the system - Is this needed???
     - Change Snail AI, make it not depend on phony walls? Maybe use paths?
     - Possibly add a wall_group entity instead of having an individual entity for each
           wall

 - Improve asset system
     - Origin for animations so it displays properly. - Is this needed???
     - Formalize asset loading

 - Hotloading
     - Variables file a la Jonathan Blow's games
     - Perhaps do searching in the map section of asset files

 - Load PNG files (should I just use stb_image?)
     Currently stb_image is being used.
 - Use the new stb_truetype baking API

 - Audio!!!
 - Load WAV files
 - Error logging system

 - Multithreading & SIMD
     How to go about this if we want compatibility with older and slower machines?
 - Possibly create a 'legacy' OpenGL renderer that uses the fixed function pipeline
     for older machines

 - Investigate why the amount of time for the first frame is greater than
     succeeding frames
