TODOS:
-----------------------------------------------

 - Hotloading
     - Variables file a la Jonathan Blow's games

 - Editor
     - Drag entity path endpoints
     - Allow a variable number of coins in a level
     - Able to set PLAYER and GATE position!!!
     - Able to edit most entity attributes
         - Collision boundary editing
     - Undo/Redo
         - Maybe!!!

 - TODOS for release
     - True random number generation
     - BAKE FONTS AT COMPILE TIME!
         - Use the new stb_truetype baking API
     - Bake asset file
     - Bake PNGs into a custom format, or maybe just a BMP
     - Better platform layer/s
     - Multiple rendering APIs
         - Fixed function OpenGL
         - Linux
             - Modern OpenGL
             - Vulkan???
         - Mac        
             - Metal
         - Windows
             - Direct3D
 
 - Better profiler, use milliseconds

 - Do step up onto dragonfly body better! Make it more generalized and apply to all 
   ledges, and only move the player upwards, instead of moving them so that when the 
   collide to be on it

 - Collision system
     - Switch to using a discrete collision system, or do continuous collision detection
       more CORRECTLY where things are all moved at once and are tested that way, instead 
       of moving one thing at a time
     - Make teleporters, use the collision system

 - Perhaps make entity ids fixed point, where the first few bits specify the entity type,
   and then the next few bits specify the index

 - Improve user input, it could be done way better! Maybe not have user input be global?
   or maybe have it driven by events?

 - Dragonfly wings in a separate asset
 - Improve the Z layer

 - Entity system
     - Fix don't use a percent for Snail AI
     - Allow different AIs for enemies
     - Snail spawner
     - Perhaps a system to calculate the snail endpoints in the editor

     - Add a wall_group entity instead of having an individual entity for each wall
     - When the player is riding a dragonfly when it turns, possibly interpolate the player
       position to look better when riding the dragonfly

 - Asset system
     - Asset 'specs' like Y-Offset, etc.
     - Allow a variable number of animations in a spritesheet_asset instead of having it
       fixed size

 - Audio!!!
     - Load WAV files

 - Proper random number generation

 - Multithreading & SIMD, should this be done if we want compatibility with older lower end
   machines?
     - SSE2 is supported on all the machines that are ideal, though it might be good to still 
       have a non-sse version maybe?

 - Possibly create a 'legacy' OpenGL renderer that uses the fixed function pipeline
   for older machines

BUGS:
-----------------------------------------------
 - Player can jump while falling
 - Player can get stuck when walking onto the dragonfly's torso, if the dragonfly happens
   to be under a platform
     - Might not be a problem if the player size changes
 - Riding on dragonfly go directly under a wall can cause the riding player to get stuck
 - Snail falls through the floor
 - Things can get stuck inside Sally, when the collision boundary changes from circle to
   square, also the current solution to this in the dragonfly is not very good

IDEAS:
-----------------------------------------------
 - Randomize enemy directions on start
