TODOS:
-----------------------------------------------

 - Hotloading
     - Variables file a la Jonathan Blow's games

 - Editor
     - Drag entity path endpoints
     - Able to set PLAYER and GATE position!!!
     - Able to edit most entity attributes
         - Collision boundary editing
     - Allow a variable number of coins in a level
     - Undo/Redo
         - Maybe!!!

 - TODOS for release
     - BAKE FONTS AT COMPILE TIME!
         - Use the new stb_truetype baking API
     - Bake asset file
     - Bake PNGs into a custom format, or maybe just a BMP
     - Better platform layer/s
     - Multiple rendering APIs
         - Fixed function OpenGL
         - Linux
             - Modern OpenGL
             - Vulkan???
         - Mac        
             - Metal
         - Windows
             - Direct3D

 - Make teleporters, use the collision system
 - Perhaps make entity ids fixed point, where the first few bits specify the entity type,
   and then the next few bits specify the index

 - Improve user input, it could be done way better! Maybe not have user input be global?

 - Dragonfly wings in a separate asset
 - Improve the Z layer

 - Better entity system
     - Fix don't use a percent for Snail AI
     - Allow different AIs for enemies
     - Snail spawner
     - Perhaps a system to calculate the snail endpoints in the editor

     - Add a wall_group entity instead of having an individual entity for each wall
     - When the player is riding a dragonfly when it turns, possibly interpolate the player
       position to look better when riding the dragonfly

 - Improve asset system
     - Formalize player spawn
     - Asset 'specs' like Y-Offset, etc.
     - Allow a variable number of animations in a spritesheet_asset instead of having it
       fixed size

 - Audio!!!
     - Load WAV files

 - Proper random number generation

 - Multithreading & SIMD, should this be done if we want compatibility with older lower end
   machines?

 - Possibly create a 'legacy' OpenGL renderer that uses the fixed function pipeline
   for older machines

BUGS:
-----------------------------------------------
 - Investigate why the amount of time for the first frame is greater that succeeding frames
     - Is this still a problem???

 - Snail direction sometimes change at start
 - In editor, remove last level doesn't check the current level
 - Score doesn't reset on level change, easy fix
 - Friction isn't applied if a player quickly changes the direction they are moving
 - Player can jump while falling
 - Player can kinda fall through dragonfly when turning
 - Player can get stuck when walking onto the dragonfly's torso, if the dragonfly happens
   to be under a platform
     - Might not be a problem if the player size changes
 - POSSIBLY: Collision event should be reset when a new collision is detected
 - Riding on dragonfly go directly under a wall can cause the riding player to get stuck
 - Dragonflies don't move with two collision boxes
 - Snails sometimes do the turning animation twice
 - Snail falls through the floor
IDEAS:
-----------------------------------------------
 - Randomize enemy directions on start
